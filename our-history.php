                    <p>If you‚Äôre looking for a pizza restaurant in Santa Fe, you won‚Äôt have any trouble finding one. Back in 1979, however, when Upper Crust Pizza opened up in an old jewelry store, it may not have been so easy finding a pizza place that makes your mouth water. And that‚Äôs why Bill and Dean got in the business of making pies. They began with a simple menu with items that are made to perfection and continued to add new items that the Santa Fe residents craved.</p>
                    <p>Today, you will find a <a href="https://www.uppercrustpizza.com/menu/">lunch and dinner</a> menu filled with everything from quiche to salads and sandwiches to pizzas and calzones. What makes Upper Crust Pizza a favorite is the fresh ingredients, dough that guests love to sink their teeth into, and a welcoming environment filled with live music, a relaxing patio, and a family-friendly atmosphere. When families visit, they can expect to feel like a part of the Upper Crust family.</p>
                    <p>Not many restaurants can claim that they have won, or win awards. However, Upper Crust Pizza has been serving up <a href="https://www.uppercrustpizza.com/awards/">award-winning</a> pizza for years. Consistently winning Best Local Pizza by the <a href="http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-12647-restaurant-guide-directory.html">Santa Fe Reporter</a>, you can expect to find unique pizza toppings such as pine nuts and green chile, as well as traditional pepperoni, sausage, and Margherita pizzas. If you want a tasty beverage to go along with your pie, order a cold brew, an elegant glass of wine, or stick to the basic fountain drinks. Many of the beer and wines are local, adding to the charm and hometown feel of the restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Come by for a quick lunch in the afternoon, or bring the whole family for pizza night on the weekend, all are welcome to our restaurant and we can‚Äôt wait to bring a steaming, cheesy, pizza to your table for you to dig into.</p>
